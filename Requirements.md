# Community Notice Board

Design Sprint requirements for a community notice board. 
These are off the top of my head. Feel free to add and modify as you see fit.

Users of the community notice board should be able to:
- view posts created by them and others
- edit posts created by them 
- create a new post
- delete posts created by them
- report a post (giving a reason) if it contains material that should not be made public
- save posts that they like
- subscribe to posts that they want updates on

Admins of the community notice board should be able to:
- do all the things regular users can do
- review reported posts and approve removal
- appoint other users as admins

Posts on the community notice board should:
- be hidden from view once reported until they are reviewed by an admin
- shared to social media through a hyperlink
- be able to contain multimedia content (images, videos, etc.)
